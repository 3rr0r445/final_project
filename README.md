# final_project
My Final Project for CodeinPlace from Stanford

I wanted to take what I'd learned and create a small text based game.
The graphics still confuse me and I'd rather reiterate and practice the programming logic.
I've looked into general tutorials for basic ideas and it's been a pretty confusing journey.
The tutorials are either incredibly simple, choice based design or a function heavy journey with a scope
far too broad for me to keep up with. Implementing combat mechanics and basically creating a MUD(Multi User Dungeon) codebase.

I'm aiming somewhere in the middle.
